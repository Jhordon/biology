            <p> Cellular Respiration is an aerobic and anaerobic process. 
                It involves the conversion of glucose into usable energy known as ATP or Adenosine Triphosphate.
                A way to remember the products and reactants of Cellular Respiration is below:

            <p> In Cellular Respiration, mitochondria gave to me: 28 to 30 ATP </p>
            <p> In Cellular Respiration, mitochondria gave to me: 6NADH, 2FADH, 4CO<sub>2</sub>, 2 ATP, and 28 to 30 ATP </p>
            <p> In Cellular Respiration, mitochondria gave to me: 2 Acetoyl-CoAs, 6NADH, 2FADH, 4CO<sub>2</sub>, 2 ATP, and 28 to 30 ATP </p>
            <p> In Cellular Respiration, mitochondria gave to me: 2 Pyruvates, 2 Acetoyl-CoAs, 6NADH, 2FADH, 4CO<sub>2</sub>, 2 ATP, and 28 to 30 ATP </p>
            <p> In Cellular Respiration, mitochondria gave to me: </p> 
            <p> From 1 single glucose: 2 Pyruvates, 2 Acetoyl-CoAs, 6NADH, 2FADH, 4CO<sub>2</sub>, 2 ATP, and 28 to 30 ATP </p>
